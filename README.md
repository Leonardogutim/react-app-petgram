# App development project using React ⚛️

This is a project where I try to replicate the home page of the Instagram app.
I have used React from the VSC editor

These are some of the technologies that I used for the project:

In this course we will make an application very similar to Instagram, called petgram. We will have our routes, user management and likes.

We will use as packer and transpiler:

     Webpack
     Babel

Styled with CSS in JS with:

     styled-components

As linter we will use:

     Standard JS

For data fetching:

     GraphQL
     React Apollo

For the routing of the SPA we will use:

     Reach Router

For good practices we will use:

     Lighthouse
     Cypress

Finally we will do SEO, PWA and Deploy with:

     React Helmet
     Workbox
     Progressive Web App
     Deply with Now
